# CF-account-Merge

This is a java desktop program using java swing and Codeforces API.

Problem:
1. I have two codeforces account and ocassionally practice from both of them. I was faced with the problem of picking practice problems which I haven't solved on either account (ofcourse solving problems you've already solved isn't interesting). Manually checking this was hectic.

2. Occassionally my friends and I practice on Vjudge and we have to pick problems from codeforces.com that none of the 5 of us have solved earlier. Well if for just two accounts was hectic imagine doing that for 5 accounts

Solution: 
This program just automates the process by selecting problems that haven't been solved on any of the accounts indicated by the user.

UPD1: Bugs fixed, exceptions handled due to HTTP errors;

coming updates: 
1. users will be able to compare more than 2 accounts.
2. bug will be fixed: when user types a handle with spaces an error occurs.
3. problem selection will be randomized.
